  <h3 style="text-align: center;">History of burgers</h3>
<p>Burgers have a fascinating history that stretches back centuries, evolving from humble beginnings to becoming one of the most beloved fast foods worldwide.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Ancient Roots: Ground meat patties have been part of various cultures for centuries. Ancient Romans, for example, ate a dish called "Isicia Omentata," which consisted of seasoned minced meat formed into patties.</li>
<br>
  <li>Hamburg, Germany: The modern burger as we know it is often traced back to Hamburg, Germany, in the 19th century. Sailors passing through the port city were served a similar dish known as "Hamburg steak," made of minced beef. It was popularized further by German immigrants who brought the recipe to the United States.  </li>
  <br>
  <li>The Advent of the Hamburger: The term "hamburger" became popular in the late 19th and early 20th centuries in the United States. One of the earliest documented instances of a hamburger resembling the modern version was at the 1904 World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri, where it was served by Fletcher Davis.  </li>
<br>
  <li>White Castle: Often regarded as the first fast-food chain, White Castle was founded in 1921 in Wichita, Kansas, by Billy Ingram and Walter Anderson. They standardized the hamburger-making process, introducing mass production techniques that allowed for consistent quality and rapid service.  </li>
<br>
  <li>McDonald's and the Rise of Fast Food: The iconic McDonald's franchise, founded by Richard and Maurice McDonald in 1940, played a significant role in popularizing burgers and the concept of fast food. Their efficient assembly line system and focus on consistency revolutionized the industry.</li>
<br>
  <li>Innovations and Variations: Over the years, the burger has undergone numerous innovations and variations. From the introduction of cheeseburgers to the rise of specialty toppings and gourmet ingredients, the burger has evolved to suit diverse tastes and preferences.</li>
<br>
  <li>Cultural Impact: Burgers have become deeply ingrained in popular culture, symbolizing American cuisine and culinary innovation. They feature prominently in movies, TV shows, and literature, further cementing their status as an iconic food.</li>
<br>
  <li>Health and Sustainability: In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on health and sustainability in the burger industry. This has led to the rise of plant-based burgers and a renewed focus on sourcing quality ingredients.</li>
</ol>
<p>Today, burgers continue to be a beloved food worldwide, enjoyed by people of all ages and backgrounds. Whether it's a classic cheeseburger from a fast-food joint or a gourmet creation from a trendy restaurant, the humble burger remains a staple of modern cuisine</p>



<h3 style="text-align: center;">How to make a burger</h3>
<p>Ingredients</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ground beef (about 80/20 lean to fat ratio)</li>
  <li>Salt and pepper</li>
  <li>Hamburger buns</li>
  <li>Cheese slices (cheddar, American, Swiss, or your favorite)</li>
  <li>Toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, ketchup, mustard, mayo, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>Instructions</p>
<ol>
  <li>Preheat Grill or Pan: Preheat your grill or a skillet over medium-high heat. If you're using a grill, make sure it's clean and oiled to prevent sticking.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Prepare the Patties: Divide the ground beef into equal-sized portions, usually around 1/4 to 1/3 pound each. Gently form each portion into a patty about the same size as your hamburger buns. Press a slight dimple in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent it from puffing up while cooking. Season both sides generously with salt and pepper.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Cook the Patties: Place the patties onto the preheated grill or skillet. Cook for about 4-5 minutes on each side, flipping only once, for medium doneness. If you prefer your burgers more or less done, adjust the cooking time accordingly. Just before the patties are done, place a slice of cheese on top of each patty and allow it to melt.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Toast the Buns: While the patties are cooking, slice the hamburger buns in half and lightly toast them on the grill or in a toaster.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Assemble the Burger: Once the patties are cooked to your liking and the cheese is melted, remove them from the grill or skillet. Place each patty onto the bottom half of a toasted bun. Add your desired toppings on top of the cheeseâ€”lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, etc. Then, spread condiments (ketchup, mustard, mayo, etc.) on the top half of the bun.</li>
  <br>
  <li>Serve: Place the top half of the bun over the toppings to complete the burger. Serve immediately while hot and enjoy!</li>
